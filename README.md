- Practicing my Tailwindcss skills

##WHAT I LEARNED 
-Tailwind responsive layout
- usng flex 

--Practice keep it simple. It is a very difficult thing to do. 
Overthinking grid layouts can be easy to when you containerize the main div. 
I started to focus on each element instead of detailing the layout at once. One step at a time.


##WHAT TO LEARN NEXT

- Action state, hover mode and onclick that will be more on other projects.
